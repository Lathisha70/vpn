Verified via whatismyipaddress.com.

5. Browse Securely
Opened websites like Wikipedia and GitHub.

Traffic was routed through the VPN; HTTPS encryption plus VPN tunnel ensured data privacy.

6. Disconnect and Compare
Disconnected from VPN.

Browsing speed slightly increased.

IP reverted back to local ISP location.

7. Research: VPN Encryption and Privacy Features
ProtonVPN uses AES-256 encryption and OpenVPN / WireGuard protocols.

Has a no-logs policy, DNS leak protection, and a kill switch.

Benefits
Privacy Protection: Hides your IP and encrypts traffic.

Bypass Geo-blocks: Access services/content restricted to specific countries.

Security on Public Wi-Fi: Shields data on open/unsecured networks.

No ISP tracking: Prevents ISP from logging your browsing activity.

 Limitations
Reduced Speed: Encryption and routing can cause slower connection.

Free VPN limits: Bandwidth, server choices, and speed are often limited.

Not foolproof: Doesn’t protect against phishing, malware, or browser fingerprinting.

Trust in provider: You're shifting trust from your ISP to the VPN provider.

Conclusion
VPNs are powerful tools for enhancing online privacy and security. While they’re highly effective against surveillance and geo-blocking, they should be used as part of a broader privacy toolkit (e.g., HTTPS, secure browsers, password managers).
